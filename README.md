# LambdaLang

This language is based off of lambda calculus. To define an abstraction (a function) you would do it like so:
```
  (\x. x)
```
That function takes an input and gives that value as an output. To create an application (a function call), one would do as follows:
```
  (\x. x)(5)
```
 This application passes 5 to the abstraction and returns a value of 5.
